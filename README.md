# GeoClicker

A tiny Cookie-Clicker-like game that uses a single geometric shape (a circle) as the clickable object.

Features
- Click the circle to earn "shapes".
- Upgrades increase per-click value or passive shapes per second.
- Sidebar with "scenarios" that spawn random events (temporary boosts or immediate rewards).
- Autosave to `localStorage` and manual Save/Reset.
- Responsive and keyboard accessible (Space/Enter to click).
- No images — only CSS shapes.

How to run
1. Clone the repo or copy files into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required).
3. (Optional) Host on GitHub Pages by adding the files to a branch and enabling Pages.

Files
- `index.html` — main UI
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — game logic
- `README.md` — this file
